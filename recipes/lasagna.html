    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h2>Homemade Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li><strong> Onion: </strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            · Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
            · Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
            · Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
            · Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
            · Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
            · Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
            · Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
